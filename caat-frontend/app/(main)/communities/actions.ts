// Barrel for the communities server actions. The implementations live in
// ./actions/<domain>.ts (split from a single 2,455-line module in Phase 1).
// Every action keeps its original name and signature, so existing
// `import { ... } from ".../communities/actions"` call sites are unchanged.
// Shared, non-action helpers live in ./actions/_shared.ts and are intentionally
// NOT re-exported here (they were module-private before the split).
